# Step 5: Implementation

Completed the implementation of the Phase-1 Todo application.

The following files were created in the `src/` directory:
- `models.py`: Contains the `Task` data class.
- `storage.py`: Manages the in-memory list of tasks.
- `services.py`: Holds the core business logic.
- `main.py`: Provides the CLI and main application loop.

The application is now ready to be run.
